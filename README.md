# ASIC-Design-works-in-HDL

This repository includes some of my SAMPLE coursework in ASIC design laboratories. 
****
Current Samples: 
1. UART Receiver 
2. APB-Slave UART Receiver SoC Peripheral
3. Pipelined SoC Bus Protocol (AHB-Lite) - added on 11/24 

************
ATTENTION: 

All works done in this course is NDA protected, and I have deliberately destroyed some portions of the source code as this repository was made for presenting my works as a SAMPLE. 
Some required modules are not included in this repo at all. 
********
Original works (with full working module implementations) and more projects are in my private repositories. 
If you are a recruiter who wishes to view my work, please send me an email and I will open my private repository for viewing. 

again, SOURCE CODES IN THIS REPO WILL NOT RUN AT ALL!!
