# ASIC-Design-works-in-HDL
This repository includes some of my sample coursework in ASIC design laboratories. 

************
All works done in this course is NDA protected, and I have deliberately destroyed some portions of the source code

Current Samples: 
1. UART Receiver 
2. APB-Slave UART Receiver SoC Peripheral
3. Pipelined SoC Bus Protocol (AHB-Lite)
