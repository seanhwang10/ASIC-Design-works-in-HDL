Sample ASIC Design works done in System Verilog

This repository includes some of my coursework in ASIC design laboratories. 

**All works done in this course is NDA protected, so I have deliberately destroyed some portions of the source code

Original works and more projects are in my private repositories. 
If you are a recruiter who wishes to view my work, please send me an email and I will open my private repository for viewing.
